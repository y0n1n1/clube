Session: 6-digit numeric codes + QR code sharing, 12 member limit
Signals system: 5 predefined broadcasts (❓ Where is everyone?, 👋 Coming to you, 📍 Stay there, 🚪 Let's go, 🆘 SOS) — each with distinct vibration pattern, no typing
Design system:

Pure black OLED background
Zero chrome — gestures over buttons
"Drunk-proof" — large touch targets, high contrast
12 colors with idle/active/close states + glow

Proximity animations ("The Merge"):

5 distance stages with progressive intensity
Orbs grow larger, brighter, pulse faster as distance closes
<20m: background shifts to blended friend colors, haptic pulse
<5m: orb shows "HERE", celebration haptic, optional confetti

Color meshing: When friends cluster near you, their orb colors gradient-blend on facing edges, background glows with combined colors
Gestures: Swipe up for signals, swipe left for member drawer, tap orb to focus, long press for QR, shake for SOS
